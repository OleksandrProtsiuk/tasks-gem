# Tasks

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/tasks`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tasks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tasks

## Usage

Use class MathExercises to solve tasks.
Use .conditions method to show the conditions of task
Use .task<number> methods to solve tasks

Example:
MathExercises.conditions(number: 1) - conditions of task 1 is shown up 
MathExercises.task1(a: 1, b: 2) - task 1 is is solved with input (a: 1, b: 2)
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
